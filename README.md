# NLP Sentiment Analysis of Hotel Reviews

In the highly competitive hospitality industry, understanding customer sentiment and feedback is crucial for maintaining high service standards, brand reputation and improving guest experiences. Hotel reviews, widely available across various online platforms, are rich sources of insights directly reflecting guests' perceptions, experiences, and expectations. NLP analysis can be leveraged to extract insights from customer reviews at scale, where the volume and unstructured nature of these reviews pose a significant challenge in manual interpretation. Through sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition and trend analysis, hotels can identify what matters the most to their guests, gain recognition for excellence and target resources to areas requiring improvement. This may range from the quality of service, room amenities, cleanliness, to more nuanced feedback on staff interactions, check-in procedures and public brand image. 

In addition NLP analysis can be used to enhance managment of personalized marketing strategies, by further understanding their target customer base and better tailor their services ensuring customer satisfaction and retention. Alternatively, insights could be used to rebrand and attract customers of a different demographic, by anticipating guests expectations and making proactive adjustments to the services provided. NLP analysis is also valuable in providing hotels with insights on industry competitiors or differences amongst hotel branches, highlighting relative strengths and weaknesses, enabling hotels to improve their market position. In this way, NLP analysis not only provides a comprehensive understanding of guest experience and expectations, but data-driven insights can be used to innovate operations and prioritise investment across the hotel/chain ultimately enhancing the guest experience, operational efficiency and increase revenue for the organization. 

### Review of NLP Techniques

Sentiment analysis, enables the classification of reviews into positive, negative or neutral categories, providing a high-level overview of guest sentiment at scale. This technique can be fined tuned to detect sentiments related to specific aspects of the guest experience, such as accomodations, service, food and beverage. Topic modelling, can be used to discover the underlying themes within reviews without predefining hotel categories. This unsupervised learning approach is critical for uncovering reoccuring issues, that may have gone unnoted and help hotels to address areas which come up negatively or further market areas which are heavily praised by guests. Named entity recognition (NER) can be used to extract specific words or phrases from the text including names of hotels, amenities, locations or services which can be used to further refine strategies developed from feedback. Trend analysis can be leveraged to identify how guest perceptions change in response to policies, rennovations, changes in managment or style of service. This helps hotels to analyse the impact of changes made, and the impact on guest satisfaction.
